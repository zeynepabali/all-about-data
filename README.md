# All About Data

All the work I (have done) / (am doing) / (will do) about -hopefully public- Data Science projects, as structured as I can keep it.

This may include but not limited to DataCamp courses/project, Coursera courses about various subjects, daily coding challanges, Kaggle projects, etc.
